Incomplete actions:
 - Random number generation not quite random
 - Machine Learning for computer
 - Merge HandValueInv and HandValue classes using inheritence to reduce repeated code. Also note there is repeated code within the getStraightCards function. Prime target.

Bugs:
 - Bug in detecting straight flushs: See line 98 in HandValue.cpp. This was patched
 - Bug in detecting straights. See line 181 in HandValue.cpp
